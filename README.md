## Overview

The Appointment Booking System is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of scheduling and managing appointments for businesses, professionals, and clients. Built with modern technologies, this system enables users to easily book, update, and cancel appointments, while providing administrators and service providers with robust management tools and analytics. This project serves as a demonstration of integrating a React frontend with a Flask backend and a MySQL database for seamless user experiences and efficient data handling.

## Key Features

- **User Registration & Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login for clients and administrators.
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Simple and intuitive interface for booking, modifying, and canceling appointments.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Manage bookings, view analytics, and oversee user activity.
- **Availability Management:** Set and update service provider schedules and blocked times.
- **Email Notifications:** Automated confirmations and reminders for users and providers.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive UI for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Role-Based Access:** Separate views and permissions for clients and administrators.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- **Backend:** [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- **Database:** [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- **API Communication:** RESTful APIs (JSON)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Styling:** TailwindCss
- **Other Tools:** You can see all other tools used in my package.json file(frontend) and my requirements.txt file(backend).

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for React frontend)
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/) (for Flask backend)


### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chukwutem-emi/MY-BOOKING-APP.git
cd MY-BOOKING-APP
```

### Backend Setup (Flask)
1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the `.env` file with your MySQL credentials and secret keys.

4. Initialize the database:

    ```bash
    flask db upgrade
    ```

5. Run the backend server:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

### Frontend Setup (React)
1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

2. Set up the `.env` file with the backend API URL.

3. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn run dev
    ```

## How to Run the Project

1. Ensure your MySQL server is running and the database is set up.
2. Start the Flask backend server.
3. Start the React frontend development server.
4. Visit `http://localhost:1234` in your browser to access the application.
